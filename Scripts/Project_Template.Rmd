# Rationale and Research Questions

Over the past century, perceptions of dams have gradually changed, as understanding of their serious ecological issues has increased and as existing dams have aged, creating safety concerns and the need for expensive repairs. Dams block the passage of fish and other aquatic species, seriously disrupting life cycles for some species. They also impact water quality and alter natural flow. Increasingly, dam removal is pursued as an option to deal with aging dams and restore rivers. 

In this study, I seek to understand how dam removal has impacted the physical and chemical processes of one river, the Neuse River in North Carolina. From 2004-2005, three dams were removed from the Southern Fork of the Shenandoah River (see map below). The gage I will use for these analyses is downstream from these dams and should thus reflect some of the changes in flow and water quality that occurred after these removals.  

Below: The red X marks the spot of the McGaheysville Dam, which were removed along with the Knightly Dam and Rockland Dam upstream in 2004-2005. All three dams were located along the south fork of the Shenandoah River, which feeds into the Potomac.

![map of Neuse River](../Figures-and-Maps/mcgaheysvilledam.png)

I am interested in both changes in physical process and changes in chemical processes, which can vary widely according to the specific river, its history, and the dam removal process (Foley et al 2017). Dams allow for moderation of flow, often eliminating extreme flooding events. Therefore, dam removal in combination with increasing extreme weather events due to climate change could lead to more extreme and more frequent high flow events. On the other hand, natural river systems and riparian areas can be more resilient to flood events than artificially constructed channels, so true restoration could help mitigate high flow events to some extent. 

Changes in water quality are also an area of interest. Large amounts of sediment and minerals built up behind the dam may release quickly after removal, especially if the removal was sudden rather than gradual (Foley et al 2017). Over longer time, water quality is expected to improve because of restored ecological processes.

1. Question 1: Have discharge levels become more extreme since dam removal?

2. Question 2: Has there been a change in release of sediment and nutrients since the dam removal?

# Dataset Information

The dataset consists of discharge and water quality data from stream gage #01631000, which is located on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River downstream from the three dam removal sites. These data were obtained from USGS StreamStats: https://streamstats.usgs.gov/ss/. 

The dataset includes 183 parameters, but these parameters vary widely in terms of how many datapoints were collected. To choose water quality variables, I made a list of the top ten water quality parameters according to the number of observations, and then selected three that I thought would be particularly interesting and informative in light of dam removal. These three were: suspended sediments, nitrogen, and phosphate. Temperature is also included in the exploratory analyses. All of these variables could be expected to change after dam removal.

## Data Wrangling

The data were downloaded as two separate datasets: discharge ('ShenaFlow') and water quality ('ShenaWQ'). Column names were changed from defaults to be more comprehensible. Month and Year columns were added to each dataset.

The discharge dataset was summarized into two dataframes, one by month and the other by year. In both cases, discharge minimum, mean, and maximum were calculated according to the summary unit. 

The water quality dataset was transformed into a wider dataset with the four parameters of interest divided into separate columns, instead of being compiled in two columns by characteristic and value. The resulting dataframe was also summarized by month, with minimum, mean, and maximum calculated for each of the four parameters. 

The exact timing of dam removal is unknown. Given that three dams were removed between 2004-2005, subsequent analyses that compare "before dam removal" versus "after dam removal" exclude the years 2004-2005 entirely. Most of the water quality variables did not include data for these years anyway.

# Analysis

## Question 1: Flow

> Question #1: Have discharge extremes increased since the removal of the dams? Has average discharge changed since dam removal?

View minimum and maximum flow by month over time. The y-axis is logged to more easily view the distribution of values.

```{r Flow.analysis, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Monthly Minimum and Maximum Discharge Over Time"}
# View monthly min and max flow over time
ggplot(ShenaFlow_monthly, aes(x = Date)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_line(aes(y = Discharge_min), color = "mediumpurple") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Discharge_max), color = "lightskyblue2", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2004-01-01")), 
             linetype = 4, color = "gray47") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Discharge (cfs, logged)") +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "2004",
           x = as.Date("2004-01-01"),
           y = as.numeric(100000),
           angle = 90, 
           vjust = 2,
           color = "gray47")
# Extreme discharge does not appear to have increased. Check yearly to verify
```

To better visualize extremes, we'll now look at minimum and maximum flow along with average flow by year. Again, the y-axis is logged to aid with visualization. 

```{r Flow.analysis1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Yearly Minimum, Maximum, and Average Discharge Over Time"}
# View yearly min, max, mean flow over time
ggplot(ShenaFlow_yearly, aes(x = Year)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_line(aes(y = Discharge_min), color = "lightskyblue2") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Discharge_max), color = "steelblue") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Discharge_mean), color = "steelblue2") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(2004), 
             linetype = 4, color = "tomato4") +
  labs(y = "Discharge (cfs)") +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "2004",
           x = as.numeric(2004),
           y = as.numeric(100000),
           angle = 90, 
           vjust = 2,
           color = "tomato4")
# Yes, extremes appear smaller since the dam removal
```

These two graphs both suggest that maximum and minimum flows have not gotten more extreme since dam removal; in fact, they appear to be less extreme.

\newpage

```{r Flow.analysis2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Create before and after datasets
ShenaFlow.before <- ShenaFlow[ShenaFlow$Date < "2004-01-01",]
ShenaFlow.after <- ShenaFlow[ShenaFlow$Date >= "2006-01-01",]

# Create summary table to compare before and after dam removal
before_summary <- describe(ShenaFlow.before[,"Discharge"], fast = T)
after_summary <- describe(ShenaFlow.after[,"Discharge"], fast = T)
flow_summary <- rbind(before_summary, after_summary)
# rename columns
flow_summary$vars <- c("Before", "After")
colnames(flow_summary)[1] <- "Timeframe"

# Print summary table
kable(flow_summary, caption = "Summary Statistics for Discharge")
```

This table confirms that the river has not experienced more extreme discharge events since dam removal. Additionally, average flow appears to be higher since dam removal. Verify with a t-test:

```{r Flow.analysis3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# It appears that average flow may be higher since the dam removal
# Test with a t-test
t.test_before.after <- t.test(ShenaFlow.before$Discharge, ShenaFlow.after$Discharge, var.equal = FALSE)
t.test_before.after
# Not statistically different
```

Flow levels have not been significantly different before (*M* = 1594.2, *SD* = 2687.3) versus after (*M* = 1640.3, *SD* = 2009.5) the dam removal (*p* = 0.140, *t*(11202) = -1.48).

```{r flow_time_series, include = FALSE}

# Generate the decomposition

We can view overall trends by running a time series that takes seasonality into account. In the resulting graph, below, we see general trend before the dam removal in red and after the dam removal in purple.

## Question 2

**Question #2: Has there been a change in release of sediment and nutrients since the dam removal?** 
 
### Sediment

**Have sediment levels changed since dam removal?**

``` {r Sediment_Analysis, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Re-examine data, excluding small number of early points and rescaling
ggplot(data = ShenaWQ_processed[ShenaWQ_processed$Date > "1995-01-01",],

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_y_log10() 
```

View summary statistics comparing sediment levels before versus after dam removal:

```{r Sediment.analysis2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Create before and after WQ datasets
ShenaWQ.before <- as.data.frame(ShenaWQ_processed[ShenaWQ_processed$Date < "2004-01-01",])
ShenaWQ.after <- as.data.frame(ShenaWQ_processed[ShenaWQ_processed$Date >= "2006-01-01",])

# Create summary table to compare before and after dam removal
before_summary <- describe(ShenaWQ.before["Sediments_mg.L"], fast = T)
after_summary <- describe(ShenaWQ.after["Sediments_mg.L"], fast = T)
flow_summary_sed <- rbind(before_summary, after_summary)

flow_summary_sed$vars <- c("Before", "After")
colnames(flow_summary_sed)[1] <- "Timeframe"

# Print summary table
kable(flow_summary_sed, caption = "Summary Statistics for Sediment")
```

Sediment levels appear to be lower on average since dam removal.

Test whether average sediment has been significantly different before versus after dam removal:

```{r Sediment.analysis3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Test whether average sediment varied before versus after dam removal
t.test_sediment <- t.test(ShenaWQ.before$Sediments_mg.L, ShenaWQ.after$Sediments_mg.L, var.equal = FALSE)
t.test_sediment
# Sediment levels were significantly lower post (p = 0.050)
# Not possible to see whether there was a spike immediately after dam 
# removal because of gap in data

```

Yes, sediment levels have been significantly different (*t*(148.63) = 2.00, *p* = 0.047). Specifically, they have been lower post-dam removal (*M*  = 40.64, *SD* = 79.63) compared with pre-dam removal (*M*= 83.15, *SD* = 242.94).

t.test_nitrogen
# Nitrogen levels were significantly lower post

Yes, nitrogen levels since dam removal (*M* = 0.92, *SD* = 0.45) have been significantly lower (*t*(550.8) = 4.56, *p* < 0.001) compared with nitrogen levels before dam removal (*M* = 1.09, *SD* = 0.43).

### Phosphate

``` {r Phosphate_Analysis, include=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Re-examine data, zoomed in
ggplot(ShenaWQ_processed, aes(x = Date, y = Phosphate_mg.L)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Month)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(as.Date("1972-01-01"), 
                          as.Date("2022-02-17"))) +
  labs(y = "Phosphate (mg/L)")
```

View summary statistics comparing sediment levels before versus after dam removal:

```{r Phosphate.analysis2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Create summary table to compare before and after dam removal
before_summary <- describe(ShenaWQ.before["Phosphate_mg.L"], fast = T)
after_summary <- describe(ShenaWQ.after["Phosphate_mg.L"], fast = T)
flow_summary_p <- rbind(before_summary, after_summary)
# rename columns
flow_summary_p$vars <- c("Before", "After")
colnames(flow_summary_p)[1] <- "Timeframe"

# Print summary table
kable(flow_summary_p, caption = "Summary Statistics for Phosphate")
```

``` {r Phosphate_Analysis3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Plot yearly trends
ggplot(ShenaWQ_yearly, aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = Phosphate_min), color = "darkgoldenrod2") +
  geom_point(aes(y = Phosphate_max), color = "coral4") +
  geom_point(aes(y = Phosphate_mean), color = "chocolate") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Phosphate_min), color = "darkgoldenrod2") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Phosphate_max), color = "coral4") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Phosphate_mean), color = "chocolate") +
  labs(y = "Phosphate (mg/L)") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(2004), 
             linetype = 4, color = "black") +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           label = "2004",
           x = as.numeric(2004),
           y = as.numeric(1.8),
           angle = 90, 
           vjust = 2,
           color = "black")
```

Test whether phosphate levels were different before versus after dam removal:

```{r Phosphate_Analysis4, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Test before vs. after phosphate levels
t.test_phosphate <- t.test(ShenaWQ.before$Phosphate_mg.L, ShenaWQ.after$Phosphate_mg.L, var.equal = FALSE)
t.test_phosphate
# Phosphate levels were significantly lower post (p < 0.001)
```

Phosphate levels have been significantly lower (*t*(309.22) = 19.10, *p* < 0.001) since dam removal (*M* = 0.07, *SD* = 0.08) compared with during the dammed years (*M* = 0.40, *SD* = 0.27).

# Summary and Conclusions

* Flow: fewer extremes since dam removal. Restoring natural hydrology makes rivers more resilient to extreme precipitation and drought.

* Sediment:

* Both Nitrogen and Phosphate levels were significantly lower after dam removal. 

* Not enough data; need more years to confirm these findings

* Would have been interesting to look at the effects on water quality immediately after the dam removal, if we knew the timing and had the data.

* Need to monitor over time for impacts of climate change and other stressors like development.
