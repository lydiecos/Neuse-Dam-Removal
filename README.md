Completed April 25, 2022

## Project
Broadly, the goal of this project is to implement concepts learned in Water Data Analytics including data processing, exploration, visualization, and analysis, while exploring a water-related topic. Specifically, the goal of this project is to examine the impacts of dam removal on various river properties. 

## Data
The data consists of discharge and water quality data at gage #01631000, available from the USGS StreamStats program. This gage is located on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River.

## Context
Tens of thousands of dams exist across the United States, constructed for a myriad of reasons including hydroelectric power and providing reservoirs for urban areas. In many cases, resources to not exist to properly maintain these structures as they age, and over time, we have come to understand their catastrophic impacts on river ecosystems. Increasingly, dam removal is considered as an option for dealing with old dams. Dam removal has both instantaneous impacts on flow and water quality and longer term impacts, as natural hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological processes are restored. 

This project aims to explore how the removal of three dams on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River between 2004-2005 impacted discharge, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphate levels.
